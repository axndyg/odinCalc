## odinCalc

This calculator, built on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a final project submission for the Foundations course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The course is responsible for teaching the fundamentals of web-building and providing a rough guideline on how to construct the Project.
